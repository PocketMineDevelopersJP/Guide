# Introduction

## Goal

What we `server.mcbe.jp` would like to do is:

1. As a community to replace [Lobi](https://lobi.co/) **Migrate to Discord and MCBEForum**

2. Support people who want to become developers and those who are aiming for it **Gather information**

To achieve these goals, we are currently working on the following projects:

## Work in progress

- This site (server.mcbe.jp)  
It is a site for project progress report and sharing.

- Discord community  
We mainly ask questions/answers regarding chat and plugin development.

## Linked site

- [MCBE Forum](https://forum.mcbe.jp)  
The domain used by this community, `server.mcbe.jp`, was borrowed from the owner of the forum, Setsuna.
